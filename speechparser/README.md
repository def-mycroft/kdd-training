The file "main.py" should be callable.

From my testing, this is a functional solution for the HW, excepting the "transpose\_matrix" function from the
"more\_functions" module, I am stuck on that one.

Note that the speech parser uses a file titled "punctuation.txt" in order to strip punctuation from the file that is 
being parsed.

I tried to make the solution as compact as possible, especially in the solution for the speech parser.
